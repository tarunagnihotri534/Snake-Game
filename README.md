🐍 Snake Feeding Game

A classic Snake Feeding Game built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The game features smooth movement, real-time scoring, high-score persistence, and an interactive game-over experience with a restart option and YouTube subscription prompt. Players control the snake using keyboard arrow keys, eat food to grow longer, and avoid colliding with the walls. The game tracks the current score, elapsed time, and saves the highest score using browser local storage. This project demonstrates core JavaScript game logic, DOM manipulation, and event-driven programming, making it a great beginner-to-intermediate web development project.
